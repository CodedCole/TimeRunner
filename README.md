# TimeRunner
An indie isometric top-down extraction shooter with a post-apocalyptic cyberpunk setting. Go into the past to retrieve materials for the current settlement that lives on the outskirts of the ruined arcology. This project was built in Unity with C# and will be expanded upon when I have time between all my school and work.
